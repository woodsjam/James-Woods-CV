    \begin{Thesis}
    \item \emph{Evolutionary Methods in Macroeconomics} \\
      The dissertation introduces two evolutionary methods that can be
      used to solve heterogeneous and homogeneous agent stochastic
      dynamic programming problems. A third solution method, used for
      homogeneous agent models and based on viral evolution, produces
      forward looking and discounting behavior that closely mirrors
      experimental evidence without assuming that agents are forward
      looking.
